## <a name="works" > 🛠️ How it works </a>

* **Detects links within the viewport** (using [Intersection Observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API))
* **Waits until the browser is idle** (using [requestIdleCallback](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback))
* **Checks if the user isn't on a slow connection** (using `navigator.connection.effectiveType`) or has data-saver enabled (using `navigator.connection.saveData`)
* **Prefetches URLs to the links** (using [`<link rel=prefetch>`](https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-hints/#prefetch) or XHR). Provides some control over the request priority (can switch to `fetch()` if supported).
